                        The group worked together and thought of as many ways to customize a candle as we could such as seasonal themes and special events such as weddings, we also spent a lot of time thinking about different scents and looks for the candles that the customers could actually customize, finally we decided to discuss and share ideas for how to present our creation to potential customers such as using social media, and came up with multiple possible payment optiosn for our buyers.
